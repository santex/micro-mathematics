{"cursor":"17826","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn abstract algebra, the concept of a 'module' over a ring is a generalization\nof the notion of vector space over a field, wherein the corresponding scalars\nare the elements of an arbitrary ring. Modules also generalize the notion of\nabelian groups, which are modules over the ring of integers.\n\nThus, a module, like a vector space, is an additive abelian group; a product is\ndefined between elements of the ring and elements of the module that is\ndistributive over both parameters and is compatible with the ring\nmultiplication.\n\nModules are very closely related to the representation theory of groups. They\nare also one of the central notions of commutative algebra and homological\nalgebra, and are used widely in algebraic geometry and algebraic topology.\n","linknr":293,"url":"Module_(mathematics)","recorded":1362671683,"links":36,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","algebra","linear_algebra","order","mathematics","model_theory","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","ring_theory","ring_theory","ring_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Algebraic structures","Module theory|* Module"],"headings":["Introduction","Examples","Submodules and homomorphisms","Types of modules","Further notions","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/d/4/5d431365ed75ff4a9541bb25b33899db.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/4/4/244fb0cf131c843b3aca4f6d05b0e1cb.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/c/f/ccf446c4847790860ce11e3ecf0d84b7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/1/e/31e7715d9210fbd2bc9ff98b26cb7433.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/5/2/9529f28077f1a8753ac6d4dd53494504.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/5/a/95a3afb01d852d85052d427c57dab42c.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["ring","mathematics"],["scalar","mathematics"],["group","mathematics"],["scalar","mathematics"],["field","mathematics"],["ring","mathematics"],["ideal","ring_theory"],["basis","linear_algebra"],["ring","mathematics"],["field","mathematics"],["basis","linear_algebra"],["set","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["category","mathematics"],["matrix","mathematics"],["lattice","order"],["map","mathematics"],["kernel","algebra"],["annihilator","ring_theory"],["sheaf","mathematics"],["scheme","mathematics"],["algebra","ring_theory"],["module","model_theory"]],"members":["scalar","function","sheaf","matrix","map","group","kernel","basis","lattice","category","module","field","set","ring","scheme","annihilator","algebra","ideal"],"related":["Abstract_algebra","Ring_(mathematics)","Vector_space","Scalar_(mathematics)","Abelian_group","Ring_of_integers","Representation_theory","Group_(mathematics)","Commutative_algebra","Homological_algebra","Algebraic_geometry","Algebraic_topology","Scalar_(mathematics)","Field_(mathematics)","Distributive_law","Ring_(mathematics)","Ideal_(ring_theory)","Quotient_ring","Well-behaved","Principal_ideal_domain","Basis_(linear_algebra)","Free_module","Invariant_basis_number","Axiom_of_choice","Lp_space","Ring_(mathematics)","Abelian_group","Unital_algebra","Glossary_of_ring_theory","Group_homomorphism","Ring_homomorphism","Endomorphism_ring","Group_action","Monoid_action","Representation_theory","Group_ring","Bimodule","Commutative_ring","Field_(mathematics)","Vector_space","Abelian_group","Integer","Basis_(linear_algebra)","Torsion_element","Modular_arithmetic","Finite_field","Natural_number","Cartesian_product","Free_module","Invariant_basis_number","Set_(mathematics)","Function_(mathematics)","Smooth_manifold","Smooth_function","Real_number","Vector_field","Tensor_field","Differential_form","Vector_bundle","Projective_module","Swan's_theorem","Category_(mathematics)","Equivalence_of_categories","Matrix_(mathematics)","Euclidean_space","Matrix_multiplication","Ring_ideal","Subgroup","Lattice_(order)","Map_(mathematics)","Homomorphism","Linear_map","Bijective","Isomorphism","Kernel_(algebra)","Isomorphism_theorem","Category_theory","Abelian_category","Finitely_generated_module","Linear_combination","Cyclic_module","Free_module","Direct_sum_of_modules","Projective_module","Direct_summand","Injective_module","Flat_module","Tensor_product_of_modules","Exact_sequence","Simple_module","Semisimple_module","Indecomposable_module","Direct_sum_of_modules","Uniform_module","Faithful_module","Annihilator_(ring_theory)","Noetherian_module","Ascending_chain_condition","Artinian_module","Descending_chain_condition","Graded_module","Graded_ring","Uniform_module","Group_homomorphism","Ring_homomorphism","Injective","Integer","Modular_arithmetic","Preadditive_category","Additive_functor","Functor_category","Ringed_space","Sheaf_(mathematics)","Scheme_(mathematics)","Algebraic_geometry","Semiring","Commutative","Monoid","Semiring","Vector_space","Group_ring","Algebra_(ring_theory)","Module_(model_theory)","MathOverflow"]}
