Lines are an\nidealization of such objects. Thus, until seventeenth century, lines were\ndefined like this: \"The line is the first species of quantity, which has only\none dimension, namely length, without any width nor depth, and is nothing else\nthan the flow or run of the point which [...] will leave from its imaginary\nmoving some vestige in length, exempt of any width. [...] The straight line is\nthat which is equally extended between its points\" In (rather old) French:\n\"La ligne est la premiÃ¨re espece de quantitÃ©, laquelle a tant seulement une\ndimension Ã  sÃ§avoir longitude, sans aucune latitude ni profonditÃ©, & n'est autre\nchose que le flux ou coulement du poinct, lequel [...] laissera de son mouvement\nimaginaire quelque vestige en long, exempt de toute latitude. [...] La ligne\ndroicte est celle qui est Ã©galement estenduÃ« entre ses poincts.\" Pages 7 and 8\nof Les quinze livres des Ã©lÃ©ments gÃ©omÃ©triques d'Euclide Megarien, traduits de\nGrec en FranÃ§ois, & augmentez de plusieurs figures & demonstrations, avec la\ncorrections des erreurs commises Ã©s autres traductions, by Pierre Mardele, Lyon,\nMDCXLV (1645).\n\nEuclid described a line as \"breadthless length\", and introduced several\npostulates as basic unprovable properties from which he constructed the\ngeometry, which is now called Euclidean geometry to avoid confusion with other\ngeometries which have been introduced since the end of nineteenth century (such\nas non-Euclidean geometry, projective geometry, and affine geometry).\n\nIn modern mathematics, given the multitude of geometries, the concept of a line\nis closely tied to the way the geometry is described. For instance, in analytic\ngeometry, a line in the plane is often defined as the set of points whose\ncoordinates satisfy a given linear equation, but in a more abstract setting,\nsuch as incidence geometry, a line may be an independent object, distinct from\nthe set of points which lie on it.\n\nWhen a geometry is described by a set of axioms, the notion of a line is usually\nleft undefined (a so-called primitive object). The properties of lines are then\ndetermined by the axioms which refer to them. One advantage to this approach is\nthe flexibility it gives to users of the geometry. Thus in differential geometry\na line may be interpreted as a geodesic (shortest path between points), while in\nsome projective geometries a line is a 2-dimensional vector space (all linear\ncombinations of two independent vectors). This flexibility also extends beyond\nmathematics and, for example, permits physicists to think of the path of a light\nray as being a line.\n\nA line segment is a part of a line that is bounded by two distinct end points\nand contains every point on the line between its end points. Depending on how\nthe line segment is defined, either of the two end points may or may not be part\nof the line segment. Two or more line segments may have some of the same\nrelationships as lines, such as being parallel, intersecting, or skew.\n","linknr":467,"url":"Line_(geometry)","recorded":1362540122,"links":98,"instances":["geometry","geometry","mathematics","mathematics","topology","geometry","geometry","linear_algebra","geometric"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Elementary
