Each base edge and\n apex form a triangle. It is a conic solid with polygonal base.\n\nA pyramid with an n-sided base will have vertices, faces, and 2n edges. All\npyramids are self-dual.\n\nWhen unspecified, the base is usually assumed to be square.\n\nIf the base is a regular polygon and the apex is above the center of the\npolygon, an n-gonal pyramid will have C nv symmetry.\n\nIf all edges of a pyramid (or any convex polyhedron) are tangent to a sphere so\nthat the average position of the tangential points are at the center of the\nsphere, then the pyramid is said to be canonical, and it forms half of the dual\npolyhedron of a cube.\n\nPyramids are a subclass of the prismatoids.\n","linknr":307,"url":"Pyramid_(geometry)","recorded":1362665958,"links":74,"instances":["geometry","geometry","geometry","geometry","geometry","geometry","geometry","chemistry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Polyhedra","Self-dual polyhedra","Prismatoid polyhedra","Pyramids| Pyramid (geometry)","Pyramids and bipyramids|","Geometric shapes"],"headings":["Pyramids with regular polygon faces","Volume","Surface area","n-dimensional pyramids","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Pyramid.svg/240px-Pyramid.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/22/Wheel_graphs.svg/240px-Wheel_graphs.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Tetrahedron.svg/100px-Tetrahedron.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Square_pyramid.png/100px-Square_pyramid.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Pentagonal_pyramid.png/100px-Pentagonal_pyramid.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Hexagonal_pyramid.png/100px-Hexagonal_pyramid.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8b/Pentagram_pyramid.png/120px-Pentagram_pyramid.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/c/0/6c019372b2e068369829b9924b80070d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/d/9/1d926189f2a927d5866df7adef579e2b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/4/5/745a2f459d530c2f737a53cb14e40917.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/0/7/b079f086562d5ade647cd1268f28b4a6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/4/9/549841e12293926ac9a91f7b08d14978.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/7/2/172b4d87cbe76e8603f04a5125df89cf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/2/e/12e97800d879fbffc98c37b3774e2a58.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/c/0/6c019372b2e068369829b9924b80070d.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/2/2/322105526cc2ac2f2fd96b7e437d76de.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/c/e/8ce412fd7d282d7aa401738948e759e8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/a/d/aad8018e3c188b04ad96a9e623443f70.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["apex","geometry"],["plane","geometry"],["scaling","geometry"],["cone","geometry#volume"],["apex","geometry"],["vertex","geometry"],["edge","geometry"],["cell","geometry"],["cone","geometry"],["trigonal_pyramid","chemistry"]],"members":["scaling","plane","cone","apex","edge","cell","vertex","trigonal_pyramid"],"related":["Schläfli_symbol","Triangle","Polygon","List_of_spherical_symmetry_groups","Rotation_group","Dual_polyhedron","Self-dual_polyhedron","Wheel_graph","Geometry","Polyhedron","Polygon","Apex_(geometry)","Conic_solid","Self-dual_polyhedron","Regular_polygon","Tangent","Sphere","Dual_polyhedron","Cube","Prismatoid","Regular_polyhedron","Tetrahedron","Platonic_solid","Equilateral_triangle","Johnson_solid","Regular_star_polygon","Pentagram","Volume","Area","Perpendicular","Plane_(geometry)","Aryabhata","Mathematician","Astronomer","Indian_mathematics","Indian_astronomy","Area","Scaling_(geometry)","Regular_polygon","Surface_area","Perimeter","Slant_height","Inradius","Apex_(geometry)","Polyhedral_pyramid","Polyhedron","Simplex","Triangle","Tetrahedron","5-cell","5-simplex","Vertex_(geometry)","Edge_(geometry)","Cell_(geometry)","Bipyramid","Cone_(geometry)","Trigonal_pyramid_(chemistry)","Frustum"]}
