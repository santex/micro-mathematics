The expansion is uniform if all the edges are the same length.]]\n creates a rhombicosidodecahedron and a reverse expansion creates an\n icosahedron.]] In geometry, 'expansion' is a polytope operation where facets\n are separated and moved radially apart, and new facets are formed at separated\n elements (vertices, edges, etc). Equivalently this operation can be imagined by\n keeping facets in the same position but reducing their size.\n\nAccording to Coxeter, this multidimensional term was defined by Alicia Boole\nStott Coxeter, H. S. M., [[Regular Polytopes (book)|Regular Polytopes]]. 3rd\nedition, Dover, 1973, p. 123. ISBN 0-486-61480-8. p.210 for creating new\npolytopes, specifically starting from regular polytopes to construct new uniform\npolytopes.\n\nThe expansion operation is symmetric with respect to a regular polytope and its\ndual. The resulting figure contains the facets of both the regular and its dual,\nalong with various prismatic facets filling the gaps created between\nintermediate dimensional elements.\n\nIt has somewhat different meanings by dimension. In a Wythoff construction, an\nexpansion is generated by reflections from the first and last mirrors.\n\nBy dimension:\n* A regular {p} polygon expands into a regular 2n-gon. ** The operation is\n  identical to truncation for polygons, t 0,1 {p} and has Coxeter-\n  Dynkin diagram .\n* A regular {p,q} polyhedron (3-polytope) expands into a polyhedron with vertex\n  figure p.4.q.4. **This operation for polyhedra is also called cantellation,\n  t 0,2 {p,q}, and has Coxeter-Dynkin diagram . **: **: For example, a\n  rhombicuboctahedron can be called an expanded cube, expanded octahedron, as\n  well as a cantellated cube or cantellated octahedron.\n* A regular {p,q,r} polychoron (4-polytope) expands into a new polychoron with\n  the original {p,q} cells, new cells {r,q} in place of the old vertices, p-\n  gonal prisms in place of the old faces, and r-gonal prisms in place of the old\n  edges. ** This operation for polychora is also called runcination,\n  t 0,3 {p,q,r}, and has Coxeter-Dynkin diagram .\n* Similarly a regular {p,q,r,s} polyteron (5-polytope) expands into a new\n  polyteron with facets {p,q,r}, {s,r,q}, {p,q} hyperprisms, {s,r} hyperprisms,\n  and {p}x{s} duoprisms. ** This operation is called sterication,\n  t 0,4 {p,q,r,s} and has Coxeter-Dynkin diagram .\n\nThe general operator for expansion of a regular n-polytope is t 0,n-\n1 {p,q,r,...}. New regular  facets are added\nat each vertex, and new prismatic polytopes are added at each divided edge,\nface, ... ridge, etc.\n","linknr":182,"url":"Expansion_(geometry)","recorded":1362575811,"links":41,"instances":["geometry","mathematician","geometry","geometry","geometry","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Euclidean geometry","Polytopes"],"headings":["See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Expanding_pentagon.png/220px-Expanding_pentagon.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Expanding_dodecahedron.gif/220px-Expanding_dodecahedron.gif","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/CDel_node_1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/CDel_p.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/CDel_node_1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/CDel_node_1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/CDel_p.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/CDel_node.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/CDel_q.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/CDel_node_1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Cube_cantellation_sequence.svg/480px-Cube_cantellation_sequence.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/CDel_node_1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/CDel_p.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/CDel_node.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/CDel_q.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/CDel_node.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/CDel_r.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/CDel_node_1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/CDel_node_1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0e/CDel_p.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/CDel_node.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/CDel_q.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/CDel_node.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e9/CDel_r.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/CDel_node.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/CDel_s.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bd/CDel_node_1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/POV-Ray-Dodecahedron.svg/30px-POV-Ray-Dodecahedron.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["facet","mathematics"],["facet","geometry"],["truncation","geometry"],["cantellation","geometry"],["runcination","geometry"],["ridge","geometry"],["norman_johnson","mathematician"],["norman_johnson","mathematician"]],"members":["truncation","norman_johnson","cantellation","facet","ridge","runcination"],"related":["Decagon","Rhombicosidodecahedron","Icosahedron","Geometry","Polytope","Facet_(mathematics)","Coxeter","Alicia_Boole_Stott","Harold_Scott_MacDonald_Coxeter","Regular_polytope","Uniform_polytope","Facet_(geometry)","Dimension","Wythoff_construction","Polygon","Truncation_(geometry)","Coxeter-Dynkin_diagram","Polyhedron","Vertex_figure","Cantellation_(geometry)","Coxeter-Dynkin_diagram","Polychoron","Runcination_(geometry)","Coxeter-Dynkin_diagram","Polyteron","Duoprism","Sterication","Coxeter-Dynkin_diagram","Simplex","Ridge_(geometry)","Conway_polyhedron_notation","Norman_Johnson_(mathematician)","Norman_Johnson_(mathematician)"]}
