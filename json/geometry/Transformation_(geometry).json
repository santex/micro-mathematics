{"cursor":"6656","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Transformation}}\n\nIn mathematics, a 'transformation' could be any function mapping a set X on to\nanother set or on to itself. However, often the set X has some\nadditional algebraic or geometric structure and the term \"transformation\" refers\nto a function from X to itself that preserves this structure.\n\nExamples include linear transformations and affine transformations, rotations,\nreflections and translations. These can be carried out in Euclidean space,\nparticularly in dimensions 2 and 3. They are also operations that can be\nperformed using linear algebra, and described explicitly using matrices.\n","linknr":178,"url":"Transformation_(geometry)","recorded":1362543727,"links":26,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","geometry","vector_space_","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","statistics","geometry","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Functions and mappings","Transformation (function)|"],"headings":["Translation","Reflection","Glide reflection","Rotation","Scaling","Shear","More generally","References","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Glide_reflection.png/220px-Glide_reflection.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Transformation_%28before%29.png/250px-Transformation_%28before%29.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Transformation_%28after%29.png/250px-Transformation_%28after%29.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["function","mathematics"],["set","mathematics"],["reflection","mathematics"],["translation","geometry"],["matrix","mathematics"],["origin","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["plane","mathematics"],["orientation","vector_space_"],["reflection","mathematics"],["translation","geometry"],["similarity","geometry"],["function","mathematics"],["invariant","mathematics"],["data_transformation","statistics"]],"members":["plane","function","similarity","orientation","origin","matrix","invariant","reflection","data_transformation","translation","set"],"related":["Mathematics","Function_(mathematics)","Set_(mathematics)","Algebra","Geometric","Morphism","Linear_transformation","Affine_transformation","Rotation","Reflection_(mathematics)","Translation_(geometry)","Euclidean_space","Linear_algebra","Matrix_(mathematics)","Affine_transformation","Euclidean_space","Vector_space","Origin_(mathematics)","Coordinate_system","Function_(mathematics)","Mirror_image","Plane_(mathematics)","Circle_inversion","Orientation_(vector_space)_","Isometry","Euclidean_plane","Reflection_(mathematics)","Translation_(geometry)","Linear_transformation","Scale_factor","Homothety","Similarity_(geometry)","Rectangle","Parallelogram","Circle","Ellipse","Function_(mathematics)","Inverse_function","Invariant_(mathematics)","Linear_transformation","Coordinate_transformation","Data_transformation_(statistics)","Infinitesimal_transformation","Linear_transformation","Transformation_geometry","Transformation_group","Transformation_matrix"]}
