For instance, a plane\nwith Euclidean distance as metric is a metric space in which a mapping\nassociating congruent figures is a motion. Gunter Ewald (1971) Geometry: An\nIntroduction, p. 179, Belmont: Wadsworth ISBN0-534-0034-7 More generally,\nthe term motion is a synonym for surjective isometry in metric\ngeometry, M.A. Khamsi & W.A. Kirk (2001) An Introduction to Metric Spaces\nand Fixed Point Theorems, p. 15, John Wiley & Sons ISBN 0-471-41825-0\nincluding elliptic geometry and hyperbolic geometry. In the latter case,\nhyperbolic motions provide an approach to the subject for beginners.\n\nIn differential geometry, a diffeomorphism is called a motion if it induces an\nisometry between the tangent space at a manifold point and the tangent space\nat the image of that point.

Fomenko, S.P Novikov (1992)\nModern Geometry â Methods and Applications, second edition, p 24, Springer,\nISBN 0-387-97993-9\n\nGiven a geometry, the set of motions forms a group under composition of\nmappings. This 'group of motions' is noted for its properties. When the\nunderlying space is a Riemannian manifold, the group of motions is a Lie group.\nFurthermore, the manifold has constant curvature if and only if, for every pair\nof points and every isometry, there is a motion taking one point to the other\nfor which the motion induces the isometry.

Solodonikov (1993) Geometry II, p. 9, Springer, ISBN 0-387-52000-7\n\nThe idea of a group of motions for special relativity has been advanced as\nLorentzian motions. For example, fundamental ideas have been laid out for a\nplane characterized by the quadratic form x^2 - y^2 \\  in American\nMathematical Monthly. Graciela S.
