{"cursor":"2457","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":" â four square faces per vertex]] â three square faces per vertex]] In geometry,\n a 'face' of a polyhedron is any of the polygons that make up its boundaries.\n For example, any of the squares that bound a cube is a face of the cube. The\n suffix -hedron is derived from the Greek word á¼Î´ÏÎ± (hedra) which means \"face\".\n\nSometimes, in the case of a pyramid, the term face is understood to\nexclude the base.\n\nThe (two-dimensional) polygons that bound higher-dimensional polytopes are also\ncommonly called faces. Formally, however, a face is any of the lower dimensional\nboundaries of the polytope, more specifically called an 'n-face'.\n","linknr":133,"url":"Face_(geometry)","recorded":1362665957,"links":34,"instances":["geometry","geometry","geometry","geometry","geometry"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Elementary geometry","Convex geometry","Polyhedra"],"headings":["Formal definition","Facets","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Tile_4%2C4.svg/220px-Tile_4%2C4.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/33/Hexahedron.png/220px-Hexahedron.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["square","geometry"],["square","geometry"],["square","geometry"],["cell","geometry"],["edge","geometry"],["vertex","geometry"],["ridge","geometry"]],"members":["square","ridge","edge","cell","vertex"],"related":["Square_(geometry)","Square_(geometry)","Geometry","Polyhedron","Polygons","Square_(geometry)","Cube","Pyramid","Polytopes","Convex_geometry","Supporting_hyperplane","4-polytope","4-polytope","Cell_(geometry)","Edge_(geometry)","Vertex_(geometry)","Ridge_(geometry)","Euler_characteristic"]}
