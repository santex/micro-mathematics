In\nmathematical logic, equality is defined by axioms (e.g. the first few Peano\naxioms, or the axiom of extensionality in ZF set theory). It can also be viewed\nas a relation: the '[[Identity function|identity relation]]', or 'diagonal\nrelation', http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Diagonal_Relation\nthe binary relation on a set X defined by\n: \\{(x, x)\\;|\\;x\\in X\\} .\n\nThe identity relation is the archetype of the more general concept of an\nequivalence relation on a set: those binary relations which are reflexive,\nsymmetric, and transitive. The relation of equality is also antisymmetric. These\nfour properties uniquely determine the equality relation on any set S and render\nequality the only relation on S that is both an equivalence relation and a\npartial order. It follows from this that equality is the smallest equivalence\nrelation on any set S, in the sense that it is a subset of any other equivalence\nrelation on S. An equation is simply an assertion that two expressions are\nrelated by equality (are equal).\n\nThe etymology of the word is from the Latin aequalis, meaning uniform or\nidentical, from aequus, meaning \"level, even, or just.\"\n","linknr":187,"url":"Equality_(mathematics)","recorded":1362671926,"links":38,"instances":["mathematics","logic","philosophy","mathematics","mathematics","logic","mathematics","mathematics","philosophy"],"pdf":["http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf","http://www.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf"],"categories":["Elementary arithmetic"],"headings":["Logical formulations","Some basic logical properties of equality","Relation with equivalence and isomorphism","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/Eqaulity.PNG","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/a/2/5a2ff73e778c62c6e67ad14112d6b1bf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/7/5/975ca8804565c1a569450d61090b2743.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/4/0/6408e079aefee9702aa00f77228dd941.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/a/4/aa4a07b55f337b56b832df0a8ddccdc5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/f/0/0f008d6b4626fc852bdef05cafca1e92.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/4/6/94685b4eefca7e847bd859d8c427427a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/c/d/dcdddf34f6e997c6e414482234077206.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["set","mathematics"],["expression","mathematics"],["identity","philosophy"],["property","philosophy"],["predicate","mathematics"],["schema","logic"],["0","number"],["and","logic"],["difference","mathematics"],["inequality","mathematics"]],"members":["difference","schema","identity","predicate","expression","and","inequality","set","property"],"related":["Mathematical_logic","Peano_axioms","Axiom_of_extensionality","Zermeloâ€“Fraenkel_set_theory","Binary_relation","Set_(mathematics)","Equivalence_relation","Reflexive_relation","Symmetric_relation","Transitive_relation","Antisymmetric_relation","Partial_order","Subset","Equation","Logical_assertion","Expression_(mathematics)","Identity_(philosophy)","Identity_of_indiscernibles","Axiom","Property_(philosophy)","Given_any","Material_conditional","Predicate_(mathematics)","If_and_only_if","Theorem","For_any","Material_conditional","Well-formed_formula","First-order_logic","Schema_(logic)","Functional_predicate","Real_number","Real_number","Real_number","Real_number","Division_by_zero","0_(number)","For_any","Mathematical_proof","For_any","Material_conditional","For_any","Material_conditional","And_(logic)","Binary_relation","Approximation","Real_number","Difference_(mathematics)","Almost_everywhere","Quotient_set","Bijection","Category_theory","Equals_sign","Inequality_(mathematics)","Logical_equality","Extensionality","Garrett_Birkhoff"]}
