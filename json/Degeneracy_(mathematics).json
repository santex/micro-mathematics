{"cursor":"3293","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn mathematics, a 'degenerate case' is a limiting case in which a class of\nobject changes its nature so as to belong to another, usually simpler, class.\n\nA degenerate case thus has special features, which depart from the properties\nthat are generic in the wider class, and which would be lost under an\nappropriate small perturbation.\n\n* A point is a degenerate circle, namely one with radius 0.\n* A circle is a degenerate form of an ellipse, namely one with\n  eccentricity 0.\n* The line is a degenerate form of a parabola if the parabola resides on a\n  tangent plane.\n* A segment is a degenerate form of a rectangle, if this has a side of\n  length 0.\n* A hyperbola can degenerate into two lines crossing at a point, through a\n  family of hyperbolas having those lines as common asymptotes.\n* A set containing a single point is a degenerate continuum.\n* A random variable which can only take one value has a degenerate distribution.\n* A sphere is a degenerate standard torus where the axis of revolution passes\n  through the center of the generating circle, rather than outside it.\n* A degenerate triangle has collinear vertices.\n* See \"general position\" for other examples.\n\nSimilarly, roots of a polynomial are said to be degenerate if they coincide,\nsince generically the n roots of an nth degree polynomial are all distinct. This\nusage carries over to eigenproblems: a degenerate eigenvalue (i.e. a multiply\ncoinciding root of the characteristic polynomial) is one that has more than one\nlinearly independent eigenvector.\n\nIn quantum mechanics any such multiplicity in the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian\noperator gives rise to degenerate energy levels. Usually any such degeneracy\nindicates some underlying symmetry in the system.\n","linknr":144,"url":"Degeneracy_(mathematics)","recorded":1362671682,"links":25,"instances":["mathematics","geometry","graph_theory","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Mathematical concepts"],"headings":["Degenerate rectangle","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/6/8/e68787b3127deb301c03b2ba2a429a5e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/7/2/372d4cd8f272d6b1b66db8fc971f9aba.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/7/8/378ebc92b5a548838654d9feba6e36f7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/1/6/5168c8eb0070c93718ca8888004bea18.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/3/6/2/362f3b463340bef36125c2a6ee2352f7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/6/5/865c0c0b4ab0e063e5caa3387c1a8741.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/1/e/e1e1d3d40573127e9ee0480caf1283d6.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/d/b/5dbc98dcc983a70728bd082d1a47546e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/b/8/7b8b965ad4bca0e41ab51de7b31363a1.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/1/e/e1e1d3d40573127e9ee0480caf1283d6.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["point","geometry"],["eccentricity","mathematics"],["line","mathematics"],["multiplicity","mathematics"],["degeneracy","graph_theory"],["trivial","mathematics"],["pathological","mathematics"]],"members":["pathological","point","degeneracy","multiplicity","trivial","eccentricity","line"],"related":["Mathematics","Generic_property","Perturbation_theory","Point_(geometry)","Circle","Ellipse","Eccentricity_(mathematics)","Line_(mathematics)","Parabola","Tangent_plane","Line_segment","Rectangle","Hyperbola","Asymptote","Linear_continuum","Degenerate_distribution","Sphere","Standard_torus","Triangle","Collinear","General_position","Root_of_a_function","Polynomial","Eigenvalue","Characteristic_polynomial","Eigenvector","Quantum_mechanics","Multiplicity_(mathematics)","Hamiltonian_operator","Degenerate_energy_level","Symmetry","Degeneracy_(graph_theory)","Vacuous_truth","Trivial_(mathematics)","Pathological_(mathematics)","Degenerate_form"]}
