{"cursor":"63511","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n, Greek mathematician, 3rd century BC, as imagined by Raphael in this detail\nfrom [[The School of Athens]]. No likeness or description of Euclid's\nphysical appearance made during his lifetime survived antiquity. Therefore,\nEuclid's depiction in works of art depends on the artist's imagination (see\n[[Euclid]]). ]] 'Mathematics' (from Greek Î¼Î¬Î¸Î·Î¼Î± mÃ¡thÄma, \"knowledge,\nstudy, learning\") is the abstract study of topics encompassing quantity, structure, space,\nchange, and other\nproperties; it has no generally accepted\ndefinition.\n\nMathematicians seek out patterns and\nformulate new conjectures. Mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of\nconjectures by mathematical proof. The research required to solve mathematical\nproblems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry. Since the\npioneering work of Giuseppe Peano (1858â1932), David Hilbert (1862â1943), and\nothers on axiomatic systems in the late 19th century, it has become customary to\nview mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from\nappropriately chosen axioms and definitions. When those mathematical structures\nare good models of real phenomena, then mathematical reasoning can provide\ninsight or predictions about nature.\n\nThrough the use of abstraction and logical reasoning, mathematics developed from\ncounting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and\nmotions of physical objects. Practical mathematics has been a human activity for\nas far back as written records exist. Rigorous arguments first appeared in Greek\nmathematics, most notably in Euclid's [[Euclid's Elements|Elements]].\nMathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the Renaissance, when\nmathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a\nrapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the\npresent day. Eves\n\nGalileo Galilei (1564â1642) said, \"The universe cannot be read until we have\nlearned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is\nwritten. It is written in mathematical language, and the letters are triangles,\ncircles and other geometrical figures, without which means it is humanly\nimpossible to comprehend a single word. Without these, one is wandering about in\na dark labyrinth.\" Marcus du Sautoy,\n[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00sr3fm A Brief History of Mathematics: 1.\nNewton and Leibniz], BBC Radio 4, 27/09/2010. Carl Friedrich Gauss\n(1777â1855) referred to mathematics as \"the Queen of the Sciences.\" Waltershausen Benjamin Peirce (1809â1880) called\nmathematics \"the science that draws necessary conclusions.\" Peirce, p.\n97. David Hilbert said of mathematics: \"We are not speaking here of\narbitrariness in any sense. Mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are\ndetermined by arbitrarily stipulated rules. Rather, it is a conceptual system\npossessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means\notherwise.\" Hilbert, D. (1919â20), Natur und Mathematisches Erkennen:\nVorlesungen, gehalten 1919â1920 in GÃ¶ttingen. Nach der Ausarbeitung von Paul\nBernays (Edited and with an English introduction by David E. Rowe), Basel,\nBirkhÃ¤user (1992). Albert Einstein (1879â1955) stated that \"as far as the\nlaws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as far as they\nare certain, they do not refer to reality.\" French\nmathematician Claire Voisin states âThere is creative drive in mathematics, it's\nall about movement trying to express itself.\"\n[http://www2.cnrs.fr/en/1402.htm Claire Voisin, Artist of the\nAbstract]\n\nMathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields,\nincluding natural science, engineering, medicine, and the social sciences.\nApplied mathematics, the branch of mathematics concerned with application of\nmathematical knowledge to other fields, inspires and makes use of new\nmathematical discoveries, which has led to the development of entirely new\nmathematical disciplines, such as statistics and game theory. Mathematicians\nalso engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, without having\nany application in mind. There is no clear line separating pure and applied\nmathematics, and practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are\noften discovered.
