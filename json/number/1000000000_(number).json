The term \"one\nthousand million\" is used primarily to ease understanding among non-native\nspeakers of English, as many other languages use words similar to \"billion\"\n(e.g., Spanish billÃ³n) to mean one trillion (1,000,000,000,000).\n\nIn the South Asian numbering system, it is known as 100 crore or 1 Arab.\n\nThe term 'milliard' can also be used to refer to 1,000,000,000; this name very\noften appears in other languages.\n\nIn British English, a billion used to refer to a million millions. However, this\nis no longer the case. http://oxforddictionaries.com/words/how-many-is-a-\nbillion\n\nThe SI prefix giga indicates 1,000,000,000 times the base unit.\n\nSee Orders of magnitude (numbers) for larger numbers; and long and short scales.\n","linknr":209,"url":"1000000000_(number)","recorded":1362684221,"links":65,"instances":["numbers","language","number","number","programming"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Integers|199e09 1000000000"],"headings":["Selected 10-digit numbers (1,000,000,000–9,999,999,999)","Sense of scale","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg/28px-Nuvola_apps_edu_mathematics_blue-p.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Visualisation_1_billion.svg/400px-Visualisation_1_billion.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3c/Billion-cubes-new.svg/754px-Billion-cubes-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["100000000","number"],["10000000000","number"],["spanish","language"],["orders_of_magnitude","numbers"],["magic_number","programming"],["magic_number","programming"]],"members":["orders_of_magnitude","spanish","100000000","10000000000","magic_number"],"related":["List_of_numbers","Integer","100000000_(number)","10000000000_(number)","Cardinal_number","Long_and_short_scales","Ordinal_number","Factorization","Binary_numeral_system","Hexadecimal","Long_and_short_scales","Natural_number","Scientific_notation","Spanish_(language)","Trillion","South_Asian_numbering_system","Crore","South_Asian_numbering_system","Long_and_short_scales","SI_prefix","Giga","Orders_of_magnitude_(numbers)","Long_and_short_scales","Pandigital_number","Base_10","Square_number","Carol_number","Kynea_number","Motzkin_number","Fibonacci_number","Pell_number","Bell_number","Wedderburn–Etherington_number","Triangular_number","Mersenne_prime","Binary_numeral_system","Primary_pseudoperfect_number","Magic_number_(programming)","Magic_number_(programming)","Fermat_number","Alternating_factorial","Self-descriptive_number","Factorial","Colossally_abundant_number","Perfect_number","Roman_Empire","Stone_Age","Middle_Paleolithic","Savanna","Dinosaur","Cretaceous","Multicellular_organism","Eukaryote","Universe","Age_of_the_universe","Earth","Moon","Sun","United_States_dollar","Billionaire","Michael_Marcovici","Pallet","Stone_Mountain"]}
