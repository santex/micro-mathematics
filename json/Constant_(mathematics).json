{"cursor":"5322","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn mathematics, a 'constant' is a non-varying value, i.e. a value that is\ncompletely fixed or fixed in the context of use. The term usually occurs in\nopposition to [[variable (mathematics)|variable]] (i.e. variable quantity),\nwhich is a symbol that stands for a value that may vary.\n\nBy convention, constants in formulas are denoted by letters from the beginning\nof the alphabet (e.g. a, b, c), while letters at the end of the alphabet (e.g.\nx, y, z) are reserved for variables. For example, a general quadratic function\nis conventionally written as:\n\n: a x^2 + b x + c\\, ,\n\nwhere a, b and c are constants (or parameters), while x is the variable, a\nplaceholder for the argument of the function being studied. A more explicit way\nto denote this function is\n\n: x\\mapsto a x^2 + b x + c \\, ,\n\nwhich makes the function-argument status of x clear, and thereby implicitly the\nconstant status of a, b and c. In this example a, b and c are coefficients of\nthe polynomial. Since c occurs in a term that does not involve x, it is called\nthe constant term of the polynomial and can be thought of as the coefficient of\nx 0.\n","linknr":171,"url":"Constant_(mathematics)","recorded":1362667272,"links":52,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","disambiguation","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Algebra","Elementary mathematics"],"headings":["Constant function","Context-dependence","Notable mathematical constants","Constants in calculus","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/7/4/e/74e5e0cb93d2b3405f2e104ae6a27def.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/6/9/469be4d48649b220eec5867b1a387cf3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/1/8/9186d9dfa3b6f229db401564b473aff8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/f/2/bf28d411b70b50581c337bffbdcb60c9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/7/f/17f407540a4d75f5b9c7b34a8fe6c1b3.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/d/5/7/d57234266b1ac57bf1541f5a73f3ad13.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/f/5/ef5590434a387b3c4427e09d5b08baaf.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/b/5/1b5d81a587a755cb753f66568df545f9.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/0/2/b0232b5edafdaefed5f32b8bcfcfc4a4.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/6/2/562c8726db0afdf7d85399f842139d19.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/3/d/23d8611dd8516971b407c3a434fbe1c8.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["value","mathematics"],["function","mathematics"],["limit","mathematics"],["expression","mathematics"],["constant","disambiguation"]],"members":["function","expression","value","constant","limit"],"related":["Mathematics","Symbol","Value_(mathematics)","Coefficient","Constant_term","Function_(mathematics)","Nullary","Ratio","Natural_number","Calculus","Derivative","Antiderivative","Limit_(mathematics)","Constant_of_integration","Derivative","Indefinite_integral","Expression_(mathematics)","Physical_constant","Constant_(disambiguation)","Constant_of_integration","Constant_term"]}
