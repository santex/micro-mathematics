An 'open disk' is the interior of the disk excluding the bounding circle,\n  while a 'closed disk' (see closed set) is the open disk together with the\n  bounding circle.]] In geometry, a 'disk' (also spelled 'disc') is the region\n  in a plane bounded by a circle.\n\nA disk is said to be closed or open according to whether or not it contains the\ncircle that constitutes its boundary. In Cartesian coordinates, the open disk of\ncenter (a, b) and radius R is given by the formula\n: D=\\{(x, y)\\in {\\mathbb R^2}: (x-a)^2+(y-b)^2 \nwhile the closed disk of the same center and radius is given by\n: \\overline{ D }=\\{(x, y)\\in {\\mathbb R^2}: (x-a)^2+(y-b)^2 \\le\n:R^2\\}.\n\nThe area of a closed or open disk of radius R is ÏR 2 (see Ï).\n\nThe [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] is the disk generalised to metric spaces. In\ncontext, the term ball may be used instead of disk.\n\nIn theoretical physics a disk is a rigid body which is capable of participating\nin collisions in a two-dimensional gas. Usually the disk is considered rigid so\nthat collisions are deemed elastic.\n","linknr":156,"url":"Disk_(mathematics)","recorded":1362477262,"links":47,"instances":["geometry","topology","mathematics","geometry","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Euclidean geometry","Rigid bodies"],"headings":["Geometry","Topological notions","See also"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1d/CIRCLE_1.svg/220px-CIRCLE_1.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/d/0/2d05e1f15387f87456155cd96cc06235.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/9/f/69f47f0e4bc75f53b70e13bd8dc43047.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/8/4/4846ee1cdd459ab0e86c26407d2168d7.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/3/a/53af375b6ef783dc3e9902ab28f91158.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["interior","topology"],["plane","geometry"],["area","geometry"],["fixed_point","mathematics"],["annulus","mathematics"],["ball","mathematics"]],"members":["plane","interior","annulus","area","ball","fixed_point"],"related":["Interior_(topology)","Closed_set","Geometry","Spelling_of_disc","Plane_(geometry)","Circle","Cartesian_coordinates","Area_(geometry)","Pi","Metric_spaces","Two-dimensional_gas","Elastic_collision","Circular_symmetry","Compact_space","Algebraic_topology","Contractible_space","Homotopy_equivalent","Fundamental_group","Homology_group","Euler_characteristic","Continuous_map","Fixed_point_(mathematics)","Bijective","Surjective","Brouwer_fixed_point_theorem","Unit_disk","Annulus_(mathematics)","Ball_(mathematics)","Disk_algebra","Lentoid","Moment_of_inertia_of_a_uniform_disc"]}
