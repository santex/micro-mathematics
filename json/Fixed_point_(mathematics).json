{"cursor":"9603","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":":Not to be confused with a [[stationary point]] where f'(x) = 0. :Not to be\nconfused with [[fixed-point arithmetic]], a form of limited-precision arithmetic\nin computing.\n\nIn mathematics, a 'fixed point' (sometimes shortened to 'fixpoint', also known\nas an 'invariant point') of a function is a point The word point in this\ncontext means an element of the function's domain that is mapped to itself\nby the function. A set of fixed points is sometimes called a fixed set. That is\nto say, c is a fixed point of the function f(x) if and only if f(c) = c. This\nmeans f(f(...f(c)...)) = f n(c) = c, an important terminating\nconsideration when recursively computing f. For example, if f is defined on the\nreal numbers by\n\n: \\ f(x) = x^2 - 3 x + 4,\n\nthen 2 is a fixed point of f, because f(2) = 2.\n\nNot all functions have fixed points: for example, if f is a function defined on\nthe real numbers as f(x) = x + 1, then it has no fixed points, since x is never\nequal to x + 1 for any real number. In graphical terms, a fixed point means the\npoint (x, f(x)) is on the line y = x, or in other words the graph of f has a\npoint in common with that line.\n\nPoints which come back to the same value after a finite number of iterations of\nthe function are known as periodic points; a fixed point is a periodic point\nwith period equal to one. In projective geometry, a fixed point of a\ncollineation is called a double point. H. S. M.
