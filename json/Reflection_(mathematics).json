{"cursor":"6913","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n.]]\n\nIn mathematics, a 'reflection' (also spelled 'reflexion') is a mapping from a\nEuclidean space to itself that is an isometry with a hyperplane as set of fixed\npoints; this set is called the axis (in dimension 2) or plane (in dimension 3)\nof reflection. The image of a figure by a reflection is its mirror image in the\naxis or plane of reflection. For example the mirror image of the small Latin\nletter 'p' for a reflection with respect to a vertical axis would look like\n'q'. Its image by reflection in a horizontal axis would look like 'b'. A\nreflection is an involution: when applied twice in succession, every point\nreturns to its original location, and every geometrical object is restored to\nits original state.\n\nThe term \"reflection\" is sometimes used for a larger class of mappings from a\nEuclidean space to itself, namely the non-identity isometries that are\ninvolutions. Such isometries have a set of fixed points (the \"mirror\") that is\nan affine subspace, but is possibly smaller than a hyperplane. For instance a\nreflection through a point is an involutive isometry with just one fixed point;\nthe image of the letter 'p' under it would look like a 'd'. This operation is\nalso known as a central inversion , and exhibits Euclidean space as a symmetric\nspace. In a Euclidean vector space, the reflection in the point situated at the\norigin is the same as vector negation. Other examples include reflections in a\nline in three dimensional space. Typically, however, unqualified use of the term\n\"reflection\" means reflection in a hyperplane.\n\nA figure which does not change upon undergoing a reflection is said to have\nreflectional symmetry.\n","linknr":192,"url":"Reflection_(mathematics)","recorded":1362673921,"links":30,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Euclidean symmetries","Functions and mappings","Linear operators","Transformation (function)"],"headings":["Construction","Properties","Reflection across a line in the plane","Reflection through a hyperplane in ''n'' dimensions","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Simx2%3DtraslOK.png/220px-Simx2%3DtraslOK.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Simx2%3DrotOK.svg/220px-Simx2%3DrotOK.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/5/a/c5a0e087e3e04bbc7d89724150fdc96c.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/1/7/c1767bf0fe7c2539965c3127850b6d92.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/e/b/0eb7dc1486fa961e5c15e7812857486a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/9/c/e9c1c27749b24492d63dc8b353afad6b.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/7/3/07379dc4251953dc3f98b6d3b10d6a49.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/0/b/80b13ad1c0aed45775c3efc082dfb171.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/b/8/5b8b1bc15b72f1554a90296cc71a121c.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["function","mathematics"],["fixed_point","mathematics"],["plane","mathematics"],["involution","mathematics"],["matrix","mathematics"],["rotation","mathematics"],["group","mathematics"],["matrix","mathematics"]],"members":["rotation","group","plane","involution","function","fixed_point","matrix"],"related":["Mathematics","Function_(mathematics)","Euclidean_space","Isometry","Hyperplane","Fixed_point_(mathematics)","Axis_of_symmetry","Plane_(mathematics)","Mirror_image","Involution_(mathematics)","Affine_subspace","Point_reflection","Point_reflection","Symmetric_space","Euclidean_vector_space","Hyperplane","Reflection_symmetry","Perpendicular","Matrix_(mathematics)","Orthogonal_matrix","Determinant","Eigenvalue","Rotation_(mathematics)","Improper_rotation","Orthogonal_group","Cartan–Dieudonné_theorem","Euclidean_group","Group_(mathematics)","Reflection_group","Finite_group","Coxeter_group","Two_dimensions","Dot_product","Vector_projection","Euclidean_space","Hyperplane","Orthogonal","Dot_product","Vector_projection","Geometric_product","Orthogonal_matrices","Matrix_(mathematics)","Kronecker_delta","Coordinate_rotations_and_reflections","Householder_transformation","Inversive_geometry","Point_reflection","Plane_of_rotation","Reflection_mapping","Reflection_group","Cut-the-knot","The_Wolfram_Demonstrations_Project"]}
