{"cursor":"13551","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\nIn mathematics, 'orientation' is a geometric notion that in two dimensions\nallows one to say when a cycle goes around clockwise or counterclockwise, and in\nthree dimensions when a figure is left-handed or right-handed. In linear\nalgebra, the notion of orientation makes sense in arbitrary dimensions. In this\nsetting, the orientation of an ordered basis is a kind of asymmetry that makes a\nreflection impossible to replicate by means of a simple rotation. Thus, in three\ndimensions, it is impossible to make the left hand of a human figure into the\nright hand of the figure by applying a rotation alone, but it is possible to do\nso by reflecting the figure in a mirror. As a result, in the three-dimensional\nEuclidean space, the two possible basis orientations are called right-handed and\nleft-handed (or right-chiral and left-chiral).\n\nThe orientation on a real vector space is the arbitrary choice of which ordered\nbases are \"positively\" oriented and which are \"negatively\" oriented. In the three-\ndimensional Euclidean space, right-handed bases are typically declared to be\npositively oriented, but the choice is arbitrary, as they may also be assigned a\nnegative orientation. A vector space with an orientation is called an 'oriented'\nvector space, while one without a choice of orientation is called '{{visible\nanchor|unoriented}}'.\n","linknr":222,"url":"Orientation_(mathematics)","recorded":1362560161,"links":28,"instances":["mathematics","geometry","permutation","geometry","mathematics","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Linear algebra","Analytic geometry","Orientation"],"headings":["Definition","Alternate viewpoints","Orientation on manifolds","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Cartesian_coordinate_system_handedness.svg/220px-Cartesian_coordinate_system_handedness.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/d/b/8dbe24d6abdae2befe7efa8ba0e925ec.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/1/f/21f54d48ff9b213937f7387b99bf827a.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/8/b/c8b1a2af66182d32ef143ac4a431c97f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/8/e/98e91a5b0d2d19fcf46096ce5684ae10.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/8/b/c8b1a2af66182d32ef143ac4a431c97f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/5/f/a5f3c6a11b03839d46af9fb43c97c188.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/8/4/8/8482b29cc0af31fa35ff6bf04200b265.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/2/a/92a9d61111a486f12eaa1de056a38ce5.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/f/1/bf16f226b16505d15e9522d565e7fb71.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/2/0/5206560a306a2e085a437fd258eb57ce.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/b/b/a/bba69273ab8d1278f9ecf4a08c662ae8.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/6/e/d/6ed9220ed2b3821a91e89347d01432ca.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/c/8/b/c8b1a2af66182d32ef143ac4a431c97f.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Wedge_product.JPG/150px-Wedge_product.JPG","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Surface_orientation.pdf/page1-220px-Surface_orientation.pdf.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["reflection","mathematics"],["rotation","mathematics"],["signature","permutation"],["plane","geometry"],["chirality","mathematics"],["attitude","geometry"]],"members":["rotation","plane","signature","attitude","chirality","reflection"],"related":["Mathematics","Linear_algebra","Ordered_basis","Reflection_(mathematics)","Rotation_(mathematics)","Euclidean_space","Right_hand_rule","Real_number","Vector_space","Euclidean_space","Finite-dimensional","Linear_algebra","Linear_transformation","Determinant","Equivalence_relation","Equivalence_class","Standard_basis","Cartesian_coordinate_system","Isomorphism","Permutation","Signature_(permutation)","Permutation_matrix","Fundamental_theorem_of_calculus","Stokes'_theorem","Exterior_power","Binomial_coefficient","Linear_form","Dual_basis","General_linear_group","Group_action","Torsor","Manifold","Homeomorphic","Connected_space","Connected_space","Identity_component","Stiefel_manifold","Torsor","Torsor","Geometric_algebra","Euclidean_vector","Bivector","Plane_(geometry)","Tangential_and_normal_components","Manifold","Tangent_space","Topology","Orientability","Sign_convention","Rotation_formalisms_in_three_dimensions","Chirality_(mathematics)","Right-hand_rule","Even_and_odd_permutations","Cartesian_coordinate_system","Attitude_(geometry)","Pseudovector","Orientability"]}
