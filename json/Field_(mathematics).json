{"cursor":"42333","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn abstract algebra, a 'field' is a commutative ring which contains a\nmultiplicative inverse for every nonzero element, equivalently a ring whose\nnonzero elements form an abelian group under multiplication. As such it is an\nalgebraic structure with notions of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and\ndivision satisfying the appropriate abelian group equations and distributive\nlaw. The most commonly used fields are the field of real numbers, the field of\ncomplex numbers, and the field of rational numbers, but there are also finite\nfields, fields of functions, various algebraic number fields, ''p''-adic fields,\nand so forth. To avoid confusion with other uses of the word \"field\", the term\n\"corpus\" may also be used.\n\nAny field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard\ngeneral context for linear algebra. The theory of field extensions (including\nGalois theory) involves the roots of polynomials with coefficients in a field;\namong other results, this theory leads to impossibility proofs for the\nclassical problems of angle trisection and squaring the circle with a compass\nand straightedge, as well as a proof of the AbelâRuffini theorem on the\nalgebraic insolubility of quintic equations. In modern mathematics, the theory\nof fields (or 'field theory') plays an essential role in number theory and\nalgebraic geometry.\n\nAs an algebraic structure, every field is a ring, but not every ring is a field.\nThe most important difference is that fields allow for division (though not\ndivision by zero), while a ring need not possess multiplicative inverses; for\nexample the integers form a ring, but 2x = 1 has no solution in\nintegers. Also, the multiplication operation in a field is required to be\ncommutative. A ring in which division is possible but commutativity is not\nassumed (such as the quaternions) is called a [[division ring]] or skew field.\n(Historically, division rings were sometimes referred to as fields, while fields\nwere called commutative fields.)\n\nAs a ring, a field may be classified as a specific type of integral domain, and\ncan be characterized by the following (not exhaustive) chain of class\ninclusions:\n\n: '[[Commutative ring]]s' â '[[integral domain]]s' â '[[integrally closed\n: domain]]s' â '[[unique factorization domain]]s' â '[[principal ideal\n: domain]]s' â '[[Euclidean domain]]s' â 'fields' â '[[finite field]]s'.\n","linknr":543,"url":"Field_(mathematics)","recorded":1362374632,"links":55,"instances":["mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","mathematics","ring_theory","language","vector_space","language","algebra","disambiguation","mathematics","complex_analysis","abstract_algebra","mathematics","metric_space","set_theory","ring_theory"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Field
