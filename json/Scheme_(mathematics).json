{"cursor":"10512","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In mathematics, 'schemes' connect the fields of algebraic geometry, commutative\nalgebra and number theory. Schemes were introduced by Alexander Grothendieck so\nas to broaden the notion of algebraic variety; some consider schemes to be the\nbasic object of study of modern algebraic geometry. Technically, a scheme is a\ntopological space together with commutative rings for all of its open sets,\nwhich arises from gluing together spectra (spaces of prime ideals) of\ncommutative rings along their open subsets.\n","linknr":202,"url":"Scheme_(mathematics)","recorded":1362540518,"links":26,"instances":["mathematician","mathematics","mathematician","category_theory","category_theory","mathematics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Scheme theory"],"headings":["Types of schemes","History and motivation","Modern definitions of the objects of algebraic geometry","Definitions","The category of schemes","''O<sub>X</sub>'' modules","Generalizations","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/b/7/5b7d527c33dccf8c10e32883ba9c3364.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/d/b/5dbc98dcc983a70728bd082d1a47546e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/d/b/5dbc98dcc983a70728bd082d1a47546e.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/math/5/d/b/5dbc98dcc983a70728bd082d1a47546e.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["pierre_cartier","mathematician"],["sheaf","mathematics"],["product","category_theory"],["limit","category_theory"],["module","mathematics"],["sheaf","mathematics"],["joe_harris","mathematician"]],"members":["pierre_cartier","sheaf","joe_harris","limit","product","module"],"related":["Mathematics","Algebraic_geometry","Commutative_algebra","Number_theory","Alexander_Grothendieck","Algebraic_variety","Topological_space","Commutative_ring","Spectrum_of_a_ring","Prime_ideal","Glossary_of_scheme_theory","Italian_school_of_algebraic_geometry","Generic_point","Algebraic_varieties","Emmy_Noether","Maximal_ideal","Prime_ideal","Wolfgang_Krull","Topological_space","Zariski_topology","André_Weil","Finite_field","Projective_space","Jacobian_variety","Algebraically_closed","Oscar_Zariski","Zariski–Riemann_space","Algebraic_variety","Birational_geometry","Direct_limit","Locale_theory","Valuation_ring","Jean-Pierre_Serre","Claude_Chevalley","Masayoshi_Nagata","Weil_conjectures","Number_theory","Algebraic_geometry","Pierre_Cartier_(mathematician)","André_Martineau","Spectrum_of_a_ring","Alexander_Grothendieck","Spectrum_of_a_ring","Sheaf_(mathematics)","Moduli_space","Algebraic_space","Algebraic_stack","Pierre_Deligne","David_Mumford","Michael_Artin","Moduli_problem","Ringed_topos","Relative_scheme","Higher_algebraic_stack","Derived_algebraic_geometry","Homotopy_theory","Affine_scheme","Locally_ringed_space","Zariski_topology","Separated_scheme","Grothendieck","Éléments_de_géométrie_algébrique","David_Mumford","Category_theory","Ringed_space","Adjoint_functor","Integer","Initial_object","Category_of_rings","Final_object","Product_(category_theory)","Product_topology","Fibre_product","Limit_(category_theory)","Module_(mathematics)","Commutative_algebra","Commutative_ring","Locally_ringed_space","Abelian_category","Coherent_sheaf","Algebraic_stack","Moduli_space","Sheaf_(mathematics)","Étale_cohomology","David_Eisenbud","Joe_Harris_(mathematician)","Springer_Science+Business_Media","Robin_Hartshorne","David_Mumford","Oxford_University_Press"]}
