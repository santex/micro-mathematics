{"cursor":"30847","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In mathematics, a 'proof' is a demonstration that if some fundamental statements\n(axioms) are assumed to be true, then some mathematical statement is necessarily\ntrue. Cupillari, Antonella. The Nuts and Bolts of\nProofs. Academic Press, 2001. Page 3. Gossett, Eric. Discrete\nMathematics with Proof. John Wiley and Sons, 2009. Definition 3.1 page 86. ISBN\n0-470-45793-7 Proofs are obtained from deductive reasoning, rather than\nfrom inductive or empirical arguments; a proof must demonstrate that a statement\nis always true (occasionally by listing all possible cases and showing that it\nholds in each), rather than enumerate many confirmatory cases. An unproven\nproposition that is believed to be true is known as a conjecture.\n\nProofs employ logic but usually include some amount of natural language which\nusually admits some ambiguity. In fact, the vast majority of proofs in written\nmathematics can be considered as applications of rigorous informal logic. Purely\nformal proofs, written in symbolic language instead of natural language, are\nconsidered in proof theory. The distinction between formal and informal proofs\nhas led to much examination of current and historical mathematical practice, quasi-\nempiricism in mathematics, and so-called folk mathematics (in both senses of\nthat term). The philosophy of mathematics is concerned with the role of language\nand logic in proofs, and mathematics as a language.\n","linknr":795,"url":"Proof_(mathematics)","recorded":1362372611,"links":92,"instances":["mathematician","typography","proof_technique","mathematics","mathematical_logic","book"],"pdf":["http://www.math.wustl.edu/~sk/eolss.pdf","http://people.web.psi.ch/gassmann/eneseminare/abstracts/Goldbach1.pdf","http://www.math.uconn.edu/~hurley/math315/proofgoldberger.pdf","http://research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/lamport-how-to-write.pdf","http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/comparison/comparison.pdf","http://mzone.mweb.co.za/residents/profmd/proof.pdf","http://mzone.mweb.co.za/residents/profmd/profmat.pdf"],"categories":["Mathematical
